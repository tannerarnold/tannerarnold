Hi there! 

My name is Tanner, I'm 23 years of age, and I'm a hobbyist programmer. I am knowledgeable in C++, C#, Java, SQL, and Python.

This github profile serves as a private git storage for my work projects, as well as a public showcase of my work, permission permitted from the client/employer.

When I'm not hobby programming, I'm playing video games, tabletop roleplaying games, and participating in a choral/musical theatre group.
