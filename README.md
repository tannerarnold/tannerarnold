# Tanner Arnold

Detail oriented and passionate programmer. Focused on providing quality code that can be reused, and ensuring code is readable, maintainable, and modular. Excited about resolving problems and moving people forward, whether internally or externally. Enthusiastic about building community and participating in a company that cares about diversity.

When I'm not programming, I'm playing video games, tabletop games like Dungeons and Dragons, and singing in a local choir/musical theatre group.
